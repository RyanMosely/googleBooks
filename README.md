//INCOMPLETE SECTION PSEUDO CODE//
//As instructed in the readme directions for the homework, here is provided pseudo code for which I still need to get done. As the stresses of project three are prevalent and whilst I am trying to keep up with concepts, I cannot finish this portion at this time.

2.) 
/* SAVE BUTTON */
        
        //set up post listeners to add columns to the database
        //set up model for book id constraints
        //set up routes
        //make a post request in app.js to add book ID of the given list item to the database.
    
/* SAVED BOOKS COMPONENT/PAGE */
        
        //On load for Saved books page, make get request for all books on page.
        //Display response in list form in page
        //Include link to book on google books in each list item
            
            /* DELETE BUTTON FOR EACH BOOK */
        //Make deleteOne request for the given book id
        //refresh page function after request has been made


## Conclusion

I am actually very ineterested in this assignment, though I think I can complete it, the time constraints with project three has my mind all over the place. At this point, though I think I have a pretty good grasp at how CRUD operations work on a fundemental level, applying those concepts to React.js is still pretty new to me. I am looking forward to working more on this assignment, for I think it would benefit me to really understand these concepts on a more concrete level
